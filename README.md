# Disease-Drug-Networks
A hybrid project applying complex network science and machine learning to disease–drug associations. The repository includes bipartite network construction, disease–disease projection, centrality and community detection, and validation with Node2vec embeddings for insights into disease clustering and drug repurposing.
